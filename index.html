        <h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>
        <p>
          I am currently pursuing my B.Tech degree in Computer Science. I choose
          that field of study because I have always been interested in computers
          and technology, and it leads to great career options. One of my key
          accomplishments during my academic career is learning web development.
          I love to create responsive websites. I have built a lot of projects
          like Portfolio, Shopping website, Blogging website, Crop recomandation
          website, etc.

          <h3>MERN stack development</h3>
          <p>
            I specialize in building full-stack web applications using the MERN
            stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). I've developed
            several projects like SmartzAgri, a precision agriculture platform,
            and GetSetExplore Blog, a tech blogging web app with user
            authentication, CRUD features, and a fully responsive UI.

          <h3>Compatative Programming</h3>
          <p>
            I’m an active competitive programmer with a 3-star rating on
            CodeChef and achieved a top 2093 rank in Meta Hacker Cup and have
            solved over 700+ problems across various coding platforms like
            codechef, LeetCode, and geekforgeeks. My C++ skills have helped me
            excel in algorithmic challenges and problem-solving under pressure,
            consistently improving my logical thinking and coding speed.

          <h3>SQL</h3>
          <p>
            I have hands-on experience with MySQL, where I’ve designed and
            managed relational databases for real-world applications like an
            Employee Management System. I focused on writing optimized queries,
            implementing proper table relationships, and ensuring data
            consistency through normalization and indexing techniques.
